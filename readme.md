# APK Builder
- Actually, this library I prepared for AI, but I share it as well.
- Containing AI extension (ext.apk) that require two of valuable libraries.
- One is apkBuilder.ai, I build this myself.
- And the other one is apktools.
- The jar file, "apktool.jar", I get from here: https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool
- Visit the apktool repository release to get new updates.


# Installation
- For AI users, simply use command:

```
$ ai pkg addrepository 9r3i/apkbuilder
$ ai install ext.apk

```
